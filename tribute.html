            <ul>
                <li>On Oct. 31, 2008, an anonymous individual who went by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto published a white paper detailing a design for a “peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” a global financial infrastructure based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.</li>
                <li>On Jan. 3, 2009, the genesis block (or block zero) for Bitcoin was mined by Satoshi (over seven days). In this initial transaction, also referred to as a generation transaction, or “coinbase,” Satoshi famously included the following message: <br>
                “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”
                </li>
                <li>On Jan. 12, 2009, the first post-genesis Bitcoin transaction occurred between Satoshi and cryptography activist Finney in block 170. Finney is also reported to have been the first person to mine Bitcoin alongside Satoshi after the network’s launch. </li>
                <li>The first recorded use of Bitcoin in the exchange of a good or service occurred on May 22, 2010 when Floridian programmer Laszlo Hanyecz offered to pay 10,000 BTC for pizza. The initial exchange rate for Bitcoin had only been established a few months prior. The price of the two large Papa John’s pizzas was estimated at around $25 at the time of purchase.</li>
                <li>On Nov. 27, 2010, Slush Pool launched. The oldest mining pool in the Bitcoin industry, Slush Pool provided prospective miners a means to pool together computational resources to mine Bitcoin and share in the block rewards proportionate to work done. This allowed individuals lacking in abundant CPU power to collectively participate in the network’s operations and earn Bitcoin in the process.</li>
                <li>In 2022, Bitcoin is a trillion dollar asset class with mass adoption. El Salvador announced bitcoin legal tender in its territory. Thousands of echannges and hundreds of millions of wallets hold bitcoin.</li>
