<p> It is possible to create a link to internal sections of a page with anchor elements. To create an internal link,
    you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you
    want to internally link to, usually further down the page.
    You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely
    describes an element. </p>
<p>HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section
    and others.</p>
<p>This is paragraph. We use p to create a paragraph. We have to close p element </p>
<p>This is how image is done. alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the
    image fails to load. </p>
<p> target is an anchor tag attribute that specifies where to open the link. The value _blank specifies to open the
    link in a new tab. The href is an anchor tag attribute that contains the URL address of the link:</p>
<p> Sometimes you want to add an elements to your website before you know where they will link.
This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using JavaScript</p>
<p>It is possible to turn image into link. This is how it is done: </p>

</form>
<p>input elements is self-closing </p>
<p> radio buttons are type of input. You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you
    one answer out of multiple options.</p>
<h2>Use HTML5 to Require a Field </h2>
<p> You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has
    filled them out.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your
    input element, like this: < input type="text" required >
</p>
<h2>Create a Set of Radio Buttons </h2>
<p> You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.
    Radio buttons are a type of input.
    Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside a label
    element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.
    All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group.
    By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons
    within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.
    Here's an example of a radio button: </p>
<p>It is considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element, with a value that matches the value of
    the id attribute of the input element. This allows assistive technologies to create a linked relationship between
    the label and the related input element. For example:</p>
<p>
<label for="indoor">
  <input id="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>
    <label for="outdoor">
  <input id="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor
</label>
</p>
<h2>Checkboxes </h2>
<p> Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer. </p>
<p> Checkboxes are a type of input. </p>
<p> Each of your checkboxes can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside a label
    element it will automatically associate the checkbox input with the label element surrounding it.
    All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute. It is considered best practice to explicitly
    define the relationship between a checkbox input and its corresponding label by setting the for attribute on the
    label element to match the id attribute of the associated input element.
    Here's an example of a checkbox:</p>
<form>
    <label for="easy">
        <input id="easy" type="checkbox" name="difficulty">easy
    </label>
    <label for="medium">
        <input id="medium" type="checkbox" name="difficulty">medium
    </label>
    <label for="difficult">
        <input id="difficult" type="checkbox" name="difficulty">difficult
    </label>
    </form>
<p>Use the value attribute with Radio Buttons and Checkboxes

When a form gets submitted, the data is sent to the server and includes entries for the options selected. Inputs
    of type radio and checkbox report their values from the value attribute.</p>

For example:

<label for="indoor1">
  <input id="indoor1" value="indoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>
<label for="outdoor1">
  <input id="outdoor1" value="outdoor" type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Outdoor
</label>
<p> Here, you have two radio inputs. When the user submits the form with the indoor option selected, the form data will
    include the line: indoor-outdoor=indoor. This is from the name and value attributes of the "indoor" input.
    If you omit the value attribute, the submitted form data uses the default value, which is on. In this scenario,
    if the user clicked the "indoor" option and submitted the form, the resulting form data would be indoor-outdoor=on,
    which is not useful. So the value attribute needs to be set to something to identify the option.
    Give each of the existing radio and checkbox inputs the value attribute. Do not create any new radio or checkbox
    elements. Use the input label text, in lowercase, as the value for the attribute. </p>
<h2>Check Radio Buttons and Checkboxes by Default </h2>
<p> You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.
    To do this, just add the word checked to the inside of an input element. For example:</p>
<label for="a">
<input id="a" value="a" type="radio" name="test"> a
</label> <br>
<label for="b">
<input id="b" value="b" type="radio" name="test" checked> b
</label> <br>
<label for="c">
<input id="c" value="c" type="radio" name="test"> c
</label>

<h2>Nest Many Elements within a Single div Element </h2>
<p> The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.</p>
<p> The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all. Just like any other non-self-closing
    element, you can open a div element with < div > and close it on another line with < /div >. </p>
<h2> Declare the Doctype of an HTML Document </h2>
<p> The challenges so far have covered specific HTML elements and their uses. However, there are a few elements
    that give overall structure to your page, and should be included in every HTML document. At the top of your
    document, you need to tell the browser which version of HTML your page is using. HTML is an evolving language,
    and is updated regularly. Most major browsers support the latest specification, which is HTML5. However, older
    web pages may use previous versions of the language. </p>
<p> You tell the browser this information by adding the < !DOCTYPE ...> tag on the first line, where the ... part is
    the version of HTML. For HTML5, you use < !DOCTYPE html>. </p>
<p> The ! and uppercase DOCTYPE is important, especially for older browsers. The html is not case sensitive. </p>
<p> Next, the rest of your HTML code needs to be wrapped in html tags. The opening < html > goes directly below
    the < !DOCTYPE html > line, and the closing < /html> goes at the end of the page.
<h2>    Define the Head and Body of an HTML Document </h2>
<p>     You can add another level of organization in your HTML document within the html tags with the head and body
        elements. Any markup with information about your page would go into the head tag. Then any markup with the
    content of the page (what displays for a user) would go into the body tag. </p>
<p> Metadata elements, such as link, meta, title, and style, typically go inside the head element. </p>

<h1 style="color: blue;"> Chapter2 Basic CSS</h1>

<h2> Change the Color of Text </h2>
<p> Now let's change the color of some of our text. We can do this by changing the style of your h2 element.
    The property that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the color style property.
    Here's how you would set your h2 element's text color to blue:
    < h2 style="color: blue;">CatPhotoApp< /h2>
<p> Note that it is a good practice to end inline style declarations with a ";" . </p>
<h2> Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements </h2>
<p> With CSS, there are hundreds of CSS properties that you can use to change the way an element looks on your page.
    When you entered < h2 style="color: red;">CatPhotoApp< /h2>, you were styling that individual h2 element with
    inline CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
    That's one way to specify the style of an element, but there's a better way to apply CSS. At the top of your code,
    create a style block like this: <br>
    < style>            <br>
    < /style>
<br>
    Inside that style block, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2
    elements to be red, you would add a style rule that looks like this: <br>

    < style>            <br>
      h2 {              <br>
        color: red;     <br>
      }                 <br>
    < /style>           <br>
    Note that it's important to have both opening and closing curly braces ({ and }) around each element's style
    rule(s). You also need to make sure that your element's style definition is between the opening and closing style
    tags. Finally, be sure to add a semicolon to the end of each of your element's style rules.
