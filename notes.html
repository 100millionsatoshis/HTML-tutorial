<p> It is possible to create a link to internal sections of a page with anchor elements. To create an internal link,
    you assign a link's href attribute to a hash symbol # plus the value of the id attribute for the element that you
    want to internally link to, usually further down the page.
    You then need to add the same id attribute to the element you are linking to. An id is an attribute that uniquely
    describes an element. </p>
<p>HTML5 introduces more descriptive HTML tags. These include main, header, footer, nav, video, article, section
    and others.</p>
<p>This is paragraph. We use p to create a paragraph. We have to close p element </p>
<p>This is how image is done. alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the
    image fails to load. </p>
<p> target is an anchor tag attribute that specifies where to open the link. The value _blank specifies to open the
    link in a new tab. The href is an anchor tag attribute that contains the URL address of the link:</p>
<p> Sometimes you want to add an elements to your website before you know where they will link.

<p> radio buttons are type of input. You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you
    one answer out of multiple options.</p>
<h1>Use HTML5 to Require a Field </h1>
<p> You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has
    filled them out.
</p>
<p>
    For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the attribute required within your
    input element, like this: < input type="text" required >
</p>
<h1>Create a Set of Radio Buttons </h1>
<p> You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer out of multiple options.
    Radio buttons are a type of input.
    Each of your radio buttons can be nested within its own label element. By wrapping an input element inside a label
    element it will automatically associate the radio button input with the label element surrounding it.
    All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute to create a radio button group.
    By creating a radio group, selecting any single radio button will automatically deselect the other buttons
    within the same group ensuring only one answer is provided by the user.
    Here's an example of a radio button: </p>
<p>
<label>
  <input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor">Indoor
</label>
